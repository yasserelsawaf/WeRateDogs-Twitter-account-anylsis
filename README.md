WeRateDogs insights

WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators however are almost always greater than 10(11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.).In theory the rates should be 1 to 10. However, WeRateDogs disagree, hey admit almost all dogs deserve a 10 and sometimes more than that.

For this project data was collected from three different sources :

   - TheWeRateDogs Twitter archive. The ‘twitter-archive-enhanced-2.csv’file was provided by Udacity ,This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.)for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

   -  twitter API was queryed for each tweet's JSON data using Python's Tweepy library

   - The tweet image predictions file (image_predictions.tsv) for each tweet according to a neural network , which is hosted on Udacity's servers
